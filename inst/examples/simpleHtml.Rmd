# Before We Get Started...

[tint](http://github.com/eddelbuettel/tint) is straightforward mix of the (html part of the) excellent
[tufte](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte) package by JJ and Yihui, mixed with the
[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font use and color scheme
proposed by [envisioned css](http://nogginfuel.com/envisioned-css/) plus minor style changes 
such as removal of _italics_---but otherwise true to the wonderful
[tufte](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte) package for R---all baked together into a
small package providing another template. 

We support _italic_ aka *em* and **strong** annotations for text, as well as `code` snippets.

The package name is a standard package naming recursion: _tint is not tufte_.

## Margin examples

A figure.

```{marginfigure}
We know from _the first fundamental theorem of calculus_ that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
```
