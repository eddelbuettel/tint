# Before We Get Started...

[tint](http://github.com/eddelbuettel/tint) is straightforward mix of the (html and pdf
parts of the) excellent [tufte](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte) package by JJ and Yihui,
mixed with the [Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed) font
use and color scheme proposed by [envisioned css](http://nogginfuel.com/envisioned-css/)
plus minor style changes such as removal of _italics_---but otherwise true to the
wonderful [tufte](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte) package for R---all baked together
into a small package providing another template.

We support _italic_ aka *em* and **strong** annotations for text, as well as `code` snippets.

The package name is a standard package naming recursion: _tint is not tufte_.

## Margin examples

A figure.

```{marginfigure}
We know from _the first fundamental theorem of calculus_ that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
```
